# 0x00-lockboxes
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NxN chessboard.

[N Queens](/0x0C-nqueens/0-nqueens.py)
* Write a Python program that solves the N queens puzzle:
  * Usage: `nqueens N` where `N` must be an integer greater than or equal to 4
  * The program should print every possible solution to the problem
    * One solution per line
    * Solution is a list of lists containing coordinates for queen positions
  * Only allowed to import `sys` module

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally.
